# 🌌 Mythic

**Mythic** is an open-source game of staking, ascension, reputation and mythical rewards.

Players join the Mythic realm by contributing real-world value (USD, WLD, USDC, etc.), which is converted into the in-game token: **Mythic Coin (MC)**.

The goal? Become as mythical as possible — and the more mythical you are, the more you earn.

---

## 🧙 Core Concepts

- **Staking**: Part of every contribution is locked and generates yield over time.
- **Reputation**: Earned by receiving votes from other players.
- **Engagement**: Active users rise faster and reap greater rewards.
- **Voting**: Players can vote on who deserves more power (and yes, it costs MC to vote).
- **Mythic Lottery**: A mystical prize pool awarded weekly to the community’s favorite.

## 🔄 Mechanics

- 💰 All users start with a contribution (e.g., 1 USD = 1 MC)
- 🧬 Part of every deposit goes to:
  - Previous players (multi-level bonus)
  - The staking pool
  - Reputation pool
  - The Mythic System (admin + lottery + burn)

- 📤 Withdrawals only allowed from 5 MC onwards, and require reentry into the pyramid
- 🔁 Every action feeds the ecosystem: staking yield, lottery, engagement cycles

## 💻 Tech Stack (MVP)

- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **Auth**: World ID (by Tools for Humanity)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (frontend), Render/Supabase (backend)
